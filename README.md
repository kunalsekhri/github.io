Bragging About Me:

I did my masters from Carnegie Mellon University(CMU), Pittsburgh in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am really passionate about amalgation of Big Data, Cloud Computing, Machine learning and Computer Vision.
I worked as Research Assistant in CMU on analysing severity of the policies of the companies,where i used a concept similar to belief propagation. I also biometrics lab in CMU where my primarily interest was in understanding Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and use them for localization and also see how they behave with large or small interclass disparity.

Before Joining CMU, I performed a small gig at Samsung Research and Development, Bangalore, where i was part of System Software Camera Divison. My work majorly focused on imporving camera image quality in low light using multi frames in flash. I co-authored a paper in ICCV, NZ chapter on my work.
